'''import library'''
# if library is inside folder as your script you can use:
# import ExplorerURLScheme
# or explicitly point to folders with dot notation
from src.Python.ExplorerURLScheme_GeneratorLibrary.ExplorerURLScheme import ExplorerURLScheme, ExplorerURLHyperlinks

'''1) Call to libraries -- Generate multiple link pages from explicit list of links'''
# define list of link lists and generate html page
hyperlinkObject = ExplorerURLHyperlinks()
explicitURLs = (('arcgis-explorer://?itemID=2adf08a4a1a84834a773805a6e86f69e', 'link1'),
                ('arcgis-explorer://?itemID=2adf08a4a1a84834a773805a6e86f69e', 'link2'),
                ('arcgis-explorer://?itemID=2adf08a4a1a84834a773805a6e86f69e', 'link3'),)
htmlPageTitle = "ExplicitListOfURLs"
