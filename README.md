#### What is the Explorer for ArcGIS URL scheme?

A URL scheme allows you to launch a native app from another app, website, or email. You can set options in the URL that will be passed to the app you want to open, causing it to perform specific functions, such as opening a map to a specific location and scale. This capability is available on Explorer for ArcGIS for iOS and Android.

#### Explorer URL scheme overview

All Explorer URL schemes start with the identifier `arcgis-explorer` and can contain additional query parameters that follow the form:

`
arcgis-explorer://?parameter=value&parameter=value
`

The following diagram is meant to be used as a quick reference to show how the parameters can be used together. The rest of this topic describes the various parameters in detail.

#### Using URL scheme to customize map viewing experience
##### `itemID`

This is one of the simplest schemes that can be used. It requests the Item ID and attempts to open the map using the mapâ€™s default center and scale.

`itemID`: Sets Item ID for the map. The item referenced can be of type Web Map or Mobile Map Package that is shared with the current user. Mobile Map Packages will be automatically downloaded if not already on-device. If the item referenced is shared publically in ArcGIS Online, the user tapping on the URL scheme does not need to be signed in to Explorer in order to access the map.

The following examples show how you can open a specific map from a URL.

```
// open a public Web Map
arcgis-explorer://?itemID=0c900ae2a1084d27b608233921ef1a84

// open a public Mobile Map Package
arcgis-explorer://?itemID=6ca5f9cfea0c47b2969ee9750693301f

```

In addition to opening a map to the default center and scale, there are a couple ways to set the map extent to provide a custom map viewing experience. You can specify the `center` and `scale` (optionally providing `wkid`, `rotation`, `markup`, and/or `dropPin` parameters) or specify a `bookmark` from the map . Alternatively, you can `search` within the map to let Explorer determine how the initial extent should be set while also displaying the matching results. 

##### `center`, `scale`

`center` and `scale` are used in conjuction to recenter a map. The `center` parameter can include either a set of latitude and longitude coordinates (decimal degrees), a query formatted address, or feature search result. When specifying a `center`, the `scale` must also be provided. You can include an `itemID` to center within a certain map, or `center` within the user's current map.

- `center`: Centers the map to a certain location. Provide center in the following formats:
  - Comma-seperated latitude/longitude (y/x) pair in WGS84 (WKID:4326)
  - Address (plus-encode spaces) to be reverse geocoded by organization geocoder (Mobile Map Package's with locators will not utilize geocoder)
  - Feature search result (plus-encode spaces). Explorer will automatically center on top result.
- `scale`: Sets the scale in map units that the map should be rendered.


The following examples show how you can use `center` and `scale` to adjust the map view point from a URL.

```
// center within user's current map
arcgis-explorer://?center=41.780618,-88.179449&scale=9000 

// center on a coordinate pair
arcgis-explorer://?itemID=0c900ae2a1084d27b608233921ef1a84&center=41.780618,-88.179449&scale=3000

// center on a reverse geocoded address
arcgis-explorer://?itemID=0c900ae2a1084d27b608233921ef1a84&center=899+Aurora+Ave,+Naperville,+Illinois&scale=1000

// center on a feature from map. In this case, Hydrant #43141
arcgis-explorer://?itemID=0c900ae2a1084d27b608233921ef1a84&center=43141&scale=500
```

##### `wkid`, `rotation`, `markup`, `dropPin`

In addition to providing a `center` and `scale`, you can optionally specify any combination of the `wkid`, `rotation`, `markup`, or `dropPin` parameters. Note, when using any of these parameters, a `center` and `scale` is required.
- `wkid`: Provide `center` in a different spatial reference. Defaults to WKID: 4326 (WGS84) if nothing provided.
- `rotation`: Rotate the given map 0-360 degrees. Sets the rotation in degrees that the map should be rendered. Acceptable values range from 0 - 360.
- `markup`: Enable markup mode when opening a map.
- `dropPin`: Drop a pin in to highlight area of interest.

The following examples show how the `wkid`, `rotation`, `markup`, and `dropPin` parameters can be used together from a URL.

```
// rotate the map 180 degrees
arcgis-explorer://?itemID=0c900ae2a1084d27b608233921ef1a84&center=41.780618,-88.179449&scale=1000&rotation=180

// center on coordinates in NAD83 / UTM zone 19N (WKID: 26919) spatial reference
arcgis-explorer://?itemID=0c900ae2a1084d27b608233921ef1a84&center=4807094.8078305572,-1096767.7053304175&scale=1000&wkid=26919&rotation=180

// enable markup mode
arcgis-explorer://?itemID=0c900ae2a1084d27b608233921ef1a84&center=41.780618,-88.179449&scale=1000&rotation=180&markup=true

// drop pin in center of map
arcgis-explorer://?itemID=0c900ae2a1084d27b608233921ef1a84&center=41.780618,-88.179449&scale=1000&rotation=180&dropPin=true
```

##### `bookmark`

Instead of providing a center and scale, the `bookmark` parameter can be used to open the map to a specific viewpoint by specifying a bookmark from the map. When providing a bookmark, you must also provide an `itemID` for the map. You cannon provide any additional parameters besides `itemID` and `bookmark`
- `bookmark`: Adjusts map viewpoint to the specified bookmark from the map. Bookmark name should be plus-encoded for spaces.

The following example shows how to open a map to a specific bookmark within the map from a URL.
```
// rotate the map 180 degrees
arcgis-explorer://?itemID=0c900ae2a1084d27b608233921ef1a84&bookmark=Centennial+Park
```


##### `search`

The `search` parameter allows you to quickly launch a map and execute a search, returning places and feature results without having to manually type your query in the search tool.
- `search`: Executes a search, returning places and/or features. Query string should be plus-encoded for spaces.

The following examples show how you can use the search parameter in a URL.
```
// search for an address from the geocoder
arcgis-explorer://?itemID=0c900ae2a1084d27b608233921ef1a84&search=899+Aurora+Ave,+Naperville,+Illinois

// search for a POI from the geocoder
arcgis-explorer://?itemID=0c900ae2a1084d27b608233921ef1a84&search=Gas+Station

// search for a feature from map. In this case, Hydrant #43141
arcgis-explorer://?itemID=0c900ae2a1084d27b608233921ef1a84&search=43141
```
